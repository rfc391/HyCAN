# HyCAN: Hydrogen Catalyst Optimization and Nanomaterials Framework

## Overview
HyCAN is a modular framework designed for optimizing hydrogen production and nanomaterial synthesis through advanced computational techniques, AI-driven predictions, and secure data handling.

## Key Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modularized components for scalable and flexible deployment.
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning models for predicting catalyst behavior and optimizing processes.
- **gRPC Communication**: Ensures seamless interaction between components and services.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Protect research data using Cloudflare Zero Trust principles.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**: Safeguards intellectual property against quantum threats.
- **Database Solutions**:
  - Cloudflare D1 for lightweight, fast storage.
  - PostgreSQL for relational data.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Efficient and secure sharing of research datasets using IPFS.
- **ISO 9001 Compliance**: Adherence to quality management standards.

## Architecture
The framework consists of the following components:
1. **Catalyst Behavior Prediction Service** (AI-driven predictions).
2. **Hydrogen Production Optimization** (model-based analysis).
3. **gRPC Communication Layer** (for inter-service interactions).
4. **Secure Storage and Data Sharing** (Cloudflare D1, PostgreSQL, IPFS).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rfc391/HyCAN.git
   cd HyCAN
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Deploy the microservices using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the services via their respective endpoints.
