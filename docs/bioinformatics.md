# Bioinformatics Features

HyCAN's bioinformatics module enables researchers to analyze molecular and genomic data. These features support research in sustainable hydrogen energy through microbial pathways and genetic optimization.

## Key Tools
1. **Sequence Alignment**: Tools to compare and align DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
2. **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Generate evolutionary trees for comparative studies.
3. **Genomic Visualization**: Visualize genomic data in Circos-style plots.
